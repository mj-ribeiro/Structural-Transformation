## Introduction

In this document, I analyze the calibration results. I calibrated the TFP using the sectoral gross output relative to the sectoral average gross output from the US, from data and model. For the model, I used the results of gross output from previous calibration that I did to US. The objective
function that I proposed is:

$$Obj = \sum_i^N \left( \frac{ WGO_i^M - WGO_i^D }{WGO_i^D} \right)^2$$
Where

$WGO_i^D = GO_i^D/ \bar{GO}_{US}^D$

$WGO_i^M = GO_i^M/ \bar{GO}_{US}^M$

The superscripts M and D means model and data, respectively.

The main advantages of this approach are:

- It is easy to calibrate

- The objective function converges to zero in almost all countries

- It is easy to explain

- The results make economic sense

- The correlation between labor shares from data and the model is 90%

- The correlation between intermediate inputs share from data and the model is also high

Observations:

- I used a dataset 2014.

- The GDP per person employed tnat I used here is from World Bank.

- I didn't use L=1, instead I used labor (from SEA) per hundred million inhabitants. This makes more sense when comparing country results. I noticed that normalizing L=1 overestimates productivity per worker in low-income countries.

Case 1  L = 1: By equalizing labor endowments, the model forces differences in GDP to be explained by productivity. Low-income countries need higher A to compensate for their lower income levels despite having the same labor input.

Case 2 (actual L): When labor endowments reflect reality, low-income countriesâ€™ larger workforces naturally increase output, reducing the need for high A. High-income countries, with smaller workforces, rely on higher productivity to achieve high income levels.


- I removed Cyprus because it is a very small economy and the calibration for
this country is very unstable.

## Calibrated TFP

### Descriptive Statistics for TFP

Summarizing TFP statistics by sector. On average, the modern
services sector is the most productive sector, followed by traditional services.

### TFP and GDP per person employed 

As we expected, there is a positive correlation between TFP and GDP per person employed in almost all sectors.

### Aggregate TFP and GDP per worker 

Aggregate TFP is the sum of sectoral TFP weighted by labor share in each sector. The GDP per person employed is from World Bank.
